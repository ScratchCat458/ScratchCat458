# Hello ðŸ¦€

![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=ScratchCat458)

My name is Hayden and I'm a developer from a little known island called *Australia*.
My primary choice of language is Rust (hail ferris) and I use to create many of my personal projects, and sometimes I remember to share them with the world.
Outside of programming, my passions include music production and linear algebra.

## August Build 
[![Built with August](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-august-blueviolet)](https://github.com/ScratchCat458/august-build)

My most recent project is August, a task-based build system with a custom syntax.
It was my attempt to teach myself to develop parsers, write error handling and document my ideas.

## Continuity
[![Styled with Continuity](https://img.shields.io/badge/styled%20using-continuity-cc297a)](https://github.com/ScratchCat458/continuity-palette)

My attempt at making a colour palette to use in live explainations and presentations.
It is quite vibrant.
